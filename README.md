## 📌 Project Overview

This project was undertaken as part of the **Business Data Management (BDM) Capstone** for the **IIT Madras BS Degree in Data Science & Applications**.

## 🏢 About the Business

**Silicon Systems** is a B2B firm that supplies IT products, electronics, lab equipment, and services to educational institutions across West Bengal. The business faced key bottlenecks in scaling due to:

- **Inventory issues** caused by fluctuating prices/demands.
- **Competition** from low-cost, low-quality players.
- **Slow-moving SKUs** impacting product scalability.

---

## 💡 Problem Statements

1. **Inventory Optimization**  
   Inefficient stock decisions due to volatile demand and price shifts.

2. **Market Competition**  
   Loss of clients to cheaper players despite superior product quality.

3. **Slow-Moving Goods**  
   Certain new or niche SKUs aren’t receiving enough orders.

## 📊 Methodology

### 🔍 Data Sources
- **Sales Data** (July–December 2024)
- **Customer Data** (Since 2011)
- Primary data provided directly by the business owner.

### 🧹 Tools Used
- **Excel** (pivot tables, trend analysis, formulas)
- **Python** (Pandas, Descriptive Stats, Exploratory Data Analysis)
- **Manual Interviews** and domain understanding

### 📈 Key Techniques
- Sales trend and volatility analysis (via standard deviation & quartiles)
- Weighted inventory prediction (using skewness-aware mean/median logic)
- Customer segmentation (loyal vs leveraged vs lost)
- Linear regression slopes to measure client engagement over time
- Market fit mapping for slow-moving items

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- ~50% of SKUs had >15% discrepancy between mean & median sales — indicating skewed demand.
- “Volatile” SKUs were identified and benchmark inventory suggestions were made.
- 3 customer clusters were formed to strategize retention and outreach.
- Pie charts and bar graphs were used to identify dominant sectors and suggest targeted marketing.

## 🧠 Recommendations

### For Inventory Management
- Use volatility-driven benchmarks for stock decisions.
- Transition to partial stock-holding mode for fast-moving products.

### For Competitive Strategy
- Launch retention campaigns for “at-risk” customers.
- Leverage slow-moving goods as offers/freebies to recapture market.

### For Product Scalability
- Focus promotions on strong sectors (e.g., Education).
- Bundle underperforming SKUs with popular items.
